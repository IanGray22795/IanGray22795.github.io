# What Brought us here

Have you ever gotten into an arguement before. My guess would be it was heated and potentially you didn't like the person for some amount of time afterward. Well I can't say that this arguement went the same way. it was actually pretty friendly. The only issue was neither of us were going to budge from our positions me and my wife of course. This arguement wasn't of any import but was, for lack of a better term, Logic and statistically based. Meaning it was only caused because one or both sides couldn't understand the logic or statisticall probabliitiy of the situation itself.

What was it that brought this arguement on well it is talked about in media. People know it as "The Monty Hall problem"
