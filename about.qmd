This is a blog to show my work as a Data Scientist. I am a recent graduate of [BYU-I](https://www.byui.edu) with a Bachelor's of Science in Data Science. I have worked on several projects with various different companies using my skills in SQL, Python, R, Power BI, and Tableau. I am currently looking for new employment and would love to speak about any opportunities you may have at your company.
